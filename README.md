# NLP_Assignments
Natural Language Processing course assignments

## Getting Started
The course assignmets included topics like n-grams, tf-idf, word2vec, doc2vec using word2vec combined with stemming and lemmatization and removing stop words if need to improve accuracy.

### Prerequisites
You need to download some python packages so you will be able to run this.
```
nltk
genism
sklearn
matplotlib
```

### Assignment 1
Assignmet PDF isn't listed, the assignment was to learn how to use n-grams (3-grams in this case) to train on an arabic econonmy courps and predict the 2 or 1 word based on the input.
The courps was collected manualy from different websites.

### Assignment 2
Assignment 2 folder contains both assignment 2 and 3 codes. You can find the details and the datasets used in assignments PDFs listed.
We used logistic regression as a proof of concept but you can insert your own algorithm.
Running [text classification](https://github.com/MustafaSaber/NLP_Assignments/blob/master/assignment-2/text_classification.py) will run all the three models and tf-idf model will run twice one with word summation and one with word average.
